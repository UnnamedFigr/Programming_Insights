When you enter:
PRINT //HTML/BodY - it outputs root tag doesn't match
The idea is to adjust the case sensetivity. No matter input capitalization.
- Also the exceptions should give out clearer outputs.
- When you don't specify a command like PRINT it throws an exception. The exception should be caught and give put string message
